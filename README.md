[In this section, explicitly describe the steps necessary to run your project from Github repo to the program execution. Make sure you try out these steps to verify that you didnâ€™t overlook anything.]


Extra Credit Description
------------------------
The fresh_tomatoes.html file can be generated from running either ent_centre.py or fresh_tomatoes.py, since both files import each other. This allows users to edit the list of movies or the html/css of the website, run the code they are working on and see the changes immediatley.

This is a cool project.
